# Welcome to the EU Business Wallet Initiative

## Background

Within the recent launch of the [Competitiveness Compass for the EU](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/10017eb1-4722-4333-add2-e0ed18105a34_en) the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en) 
announced its plan to augment the existing legislation around digital identity and trust, as laid 
down in the eIDAS-regulation [(EU) No 910/2014](https://eID.AS) for example, by introducing the 
**European Business Wallet (EUBW)**, which is envisioned to complement initiatives around 
the [European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) and become the cornerstone of doing business simply 
and digitally in the EU, providing a seamless environment for companies to interact with all 
public administrations. 

## EU Business Wallet System Architecture

As outlined in the following figure, the *EU Business Wallet* is embedded in a 
system architecture, with an overarching *Trust Framework* defined by the eIDAS-regulation 
[(EU) No 910/2014](https://eID.AS) and optionally additional *Verifiable Data Registries* as defined 
in pertinent standards created by [W3C](https://www.w3.org).

The EU Business Wallet is interacting 
* with [European Digital Identity Wallets (EUDIWs)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) for Business-to-Consumer (B2C) processes, 
* with EU Government Wallets (EUGW) for Business-to-Government (B2G) processes, 
* with other EU-Business-Wallets in Business-to-Business (B2B) processes, 
* with employees in Business-to-Employee (B2E) processes and 
* it is integrated with existing services and data repositories. 

The EU Business Wallet is envisioned to play an important role within the
[data spaces](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/dataspace-protocol), which
are emerging within different domains and hence it has a *Data Plane* and a *Control Plane*.
Furthermore the EU Business Wallet has a *Trust Plane*, which interacts with the different
providers and repositories within the *Trust Framework*.

## Goal of the EU Business Wallet Initiative

To facilitate the trustworthy and interoperable implementation of the forthcoming European Business Wallet, 
the [go.eIDAS Association](https://go.eid.as/) has initiated the present initiative to pave the way for the European 
Business Wallet by preparing technical documents, which are planned to be provided as input for 
suitable standardisation bodies, such as [CEN](https://www.cencenelec.eu/), [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/), [ISO](https://www.iso.org/), 
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)  and [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) for example.
