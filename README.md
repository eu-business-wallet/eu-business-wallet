# Welcome to the EU Business Wallet initiative

Within the recent launch of the [Competitiveness Compass for the EU](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/10017eb1-4722-4333-add2-e0ed18105a34_en) the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en) announced its plan to augment the existing legislation around digital identity and trust, as laid down in the eIDAS-regulation [(EU) No 910/2014](https://eID.AS) for example, by introducing the **European Business Wallet (EUBW)**, which is envisioned to complement initiatives around the [European Digital Identity Wallet](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) and become the cornerstone of doing business simply and digitally in the EU, providing a seamless environment for companies to interact with all public administrations.

To facilitate the trustworthy and interoperable implementation of the forthcoming European Business Wallet, the [go.eIDAS Association](https://go.eid.as/) has initiated the present initiative to pave the way for the European Business Wallet by preparing technical documents, which are planned to be provided as input for appropriate standardisation bodies, such as [CEN](https://www.cencenelec.eu/), [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/) and [ISO](https://www.iso.org/) for example.
